Starting from basic needs such as eating, recycling, and material rentals on the main floor, the journey transitions playfully through a slide‚Äîsymbolizing a shift into experience-driven spaces. The ground floor continues the narrative by embodying IKEA‚Äôs core values: personalization, circular furniture, green living, and inclusivity through kid-friendly and small-space solutions. This path culminates in a flexible auditorium space, reinforcing community, collaboration, and expression. ‚ÄúThe Spine‚Äù acts as both a literal and conceptual axis that structures not only movement, but also the mindset behind each design zone‚Äîblending function, sustainability, and lifestyle into a seamless retail experience tailored for Gen Z.`,

Yellow Catedrais 1005 introduces warmth and playfulness, resonating with Gen Z‚Äôs vibrant lifestyle. FabBrick white wall tiles add tactile contrast with a sustainable edge, while Alulife panels and perforated mesh metals lend a contemporary industrial touch to ceilings and vertical partitions.

Complementing this are soft La Nena BC001 Neutro Terrazza and light pink (4300-04) plasters, bringing warmth and contrast to focal areas. La Nena 6019 Green plaster accents soften zones with nature-inspired calm, creating moments of rest. Seastone acoustic terrazzo wall tiles (Project Sea Stone) not only enhance sound control but also add tactile depth and character. Natural wood elements balance the palette, infusing the space with organic warmth, while perforated metal mesh structures add a touch of industrial refinement. This material composition supports spatial zoning while reinforcing the IKEA brand‚Äôs commitment to curated, youthful, and sustainable living experiences.`,

      content: `This conceptual zoning diagram illustrates the transformation of an open-plan space into a modular and interactive environment. Initially defined by a simple open layout centered around a service core, the space is restructured through a systematic division of zones into a regular grid. These zones are further refined with clearly defined programs, creating distinct yet collaborative modules that cater to different functions. In the final stage, the expression of zones takes form architecturally, resembling a series of adjoining houses around a shared courtyard. This design approach not only promotes spatial clarity and organization but also fosters community and movement through intentionally placed paths, transitions, and relationships between modules. It reflects a balance of openness and enclosure, making it ideal for adaptive, user-focused environments.`,

Workspace zones (3) are strategically grouped in yellow to emphasize areas for productivity and focus, while cabins (5) and meeting rooms (6), shown in dark grey, are distributed to support managerial tasks and collaborative efforts. The inclusion of amenities like conference rooms (2), pantry (8), and executive lounge (7) ensures user comfort and flexibility, enhancing overall work-life integration.

The variation in ceiling heights and gabled profiles not only enhance spatial identity but also improve acoustics and daylight penetration. Transparent partitions maintain visual connectivity while respecting privacy and focused work. The yellow-highlighted module on the right, likely a meeting or collaborative space, signals hierarchy and function through color zoning. Circulation is seamless, and human figures placed throughout the section emphasize ergonomics and intuitive flow, reinforcing the idea of a user-centered design.`,
