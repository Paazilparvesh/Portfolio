La Rambla, known for its never-ending motion and unpredictability, already feels like a performance. So rather than over-enhancing an already heightened reality, our goal was simple: inject joy into the everyday walkthrough music, augmented reality, and pop culture.By encouraging users to slow down and engage with their environment, this experience disrupted the 'mad walking' pace of the street, turning it into a lighthearted, interactive, and immersive journey.

Set within a compact 80 sqm footprint, the project transforms Ecoalf's identity into a platform for collective action, inviting other eco-conscious brands to cohabit and co-create. The spatial strategy encourages brand cross-pollination, with modular retail zones, flexible installations, and digital subscriptions designed to reduce energy consumption and challenge the norms of fast fashion retail.
Rooted in a mission to promote conscious consumerism, the store acts as both a showcase and a storyteller. Through curated product narratives, interactive educational elements, and shared creative resources, the space becomes a living manifesto: There is no Planet B. Now is the time.

The concept was built around the idea that each department functions as a home, while the spaces in between act as courtyard shared zones that encourage informal conversations, impromptu meetings, and cross-team collaboration. These courtyards were not only spatial buffers but also creative catalysts: designed with whiteboard walls, they served as flexible canvases for brainstorming, casual meetups, and daily standups.
