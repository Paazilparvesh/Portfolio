// INTRODUCTION OF ME ( this has to come in the portfolio navigation bar with my picture)

// Hello, I'm Mohamed Safwan, a recent masters graduate in Retail Design at Elisava school of design and engineering, a spatial designer and sometimes an amateur shutterbug. My passion lies in creating designs that resonate with people and enhance convenience, reflecting my deep interest in human and societal needs. I am particularly drawn to branding, marketing, and problem-solving, aspiring to develop ideas and solutions that positively impact lives and brands.

// When I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not designing spaces, I find creative flow in graphics, branding, and music. These disciplines feed into my architectural thinking√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùeach with its rhythm, structure, and emotion.
// My travels have shaped my visual sensibility, curating a narrative that continues on platforms like Instagram. And my daily ritual√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùcoffee√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùhas become more than just caffeine. It's a quiet catalyst for conversation, often sparking unexpected collaborations, design dialogues, or simply inviting a moment of stillness in an otherwise kinetic world. Please enjoy my portfolio and discover the fun and functionality woven into my work.
